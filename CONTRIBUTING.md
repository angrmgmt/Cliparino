The files in the src and src/Managers directories of the Cliparino project folder constitute the primary code portion of the app.
The only difference between them and what is in the .sb file is all the documentation comments and linter directives and stuff that Streamer.bot doesn't really know what to do with.
Speaking of which, feel free to set up automation making use of the FileProcessor project's FileCleaner app, which will make the Streamer.bot-friendly file automatically for you.
I used the dotnet run approach, but you do you.
